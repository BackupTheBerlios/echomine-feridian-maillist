Subject: [Echomine Feridian] [Announce] Feridian 1.0b4 Released! Looking for
	Help too!
Message-ID: <63A6C7D2-2681-4E42-A600-044C4ECF21C4@echomine.com>

Hi everyone!

Today, I bring you good news that Feridian 1.0b4 is released.  This  
version fixes a showstopping bug where any packet sent  
programmatically will close the connection.  This and a few other  
bugs were fixed.

You can download the newest version at:

http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=4185

You can also point Maven to Echomine's repository to download the  
newest Feridian version at:

http://echomine.berlios.de/maven2


I will actually begin adding more features to the API, specifically  
MUC and PubSub.


Thanks,
Chris
